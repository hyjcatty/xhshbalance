Please install the Node.js v5.1.0 or higher (higher than 6.0 is not recommended).
IF your environment have not install the gulp & webpack, u neek install them first:
npm install gulp -g
npm install webpack -g
npm install -g node-gyp
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools

pay attention: these command may need administrator power.

Then add your npm node path into System PATH, and keep command "gulp" & "webpack" can run everywhere.

Change your work DIR to source folder.
Keep your internet link fluent, or you can use the set the npm mirror in your country.
1) Prepare the environment for node_modules, command:
npm install --save-dev

You may face some compile error under windows for MOSCA, it will be OK if your windows-build-tools install correctly.
2) build the source, command:
npm run build
3) copy the useful resource to the deliver folder, command:
gulp

before gulp, u can open the gulpfile.js as a text file, can modify some replace marco information.
